### MeshGPT-preview

MeshGPT is a text-to-3D model based on an autoencoder (tokenizer) and a transformer to generate the tokens.

The autoencoder's purpose is to be able to translate 3D models into tokens which then the decoder part of it can convert back to 3D mesh.<br/>

For all purposes and definitions the autoencoder is the **world first** published **3D model tokenizer**! (correct me if i'm wrong!)
