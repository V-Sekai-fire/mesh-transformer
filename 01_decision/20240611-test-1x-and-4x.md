No delete the instance and run just one 4090 or two
iFire — Today at 16:53
yes that's what I mean
LogicWin, Marcus Lopp, Meshgpt — Today at 16:54
While you do that, can you startup another instance? I think it's due to we have started two training runs in the same pod
iFire — Today at 16:54
I think I get what you mean, but I'll repeat
LogicWin, Marcus Lopp, Meshgpt — Today at 16:54
So start s pod that is X1 4090 and another new 4x 4090
iFire — Today at 16:54
We should have two pods doing one training run for paralleling. One each.
 
oh!
yeah.
what should I name them
LogicWin, Marcus Lopp, Meshgpt — Today at 16:56
The first one with single X1 will be stable. The second one with 4x 4090 we can test the theory that you can only run the multi GPU once per session
